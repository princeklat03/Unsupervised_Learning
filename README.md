# Unsupervised_Learning

Objective:

- Use k-means clustering for image segmentation and to identify dominant color in the image.

**Question:**
- Display the image “dog.jpeg”. Convert the image in to numpy array,so that it can be used in further processing
- Find out the dimensions of the image and convert it in to a two-dimensional array
- Use kmeans clustering with k set to 5 and cluster the image
- Predict the cluster label of every pixel in the image and plot it back as an image
- Find out the three dominant color in the image
